## Simple react app created as a recruitment task.  
### It's a gallery of images fetched from unsplash API.


### This app has 3 main views:  
  * overall view of few galleries
  * view of particular gallery with images from that gallery in a masonry layout with infinite scroll
  * view of particular image with detailed info

### Main obstacles:
  * do not use CRA: I configured simple webpack from scratch
  * infinite scroll
  * masonry layout

### App created at my very beginning of Front-End Developer career
